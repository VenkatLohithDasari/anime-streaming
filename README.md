# Anime Streaming Website (Version 1)

Welcome to the Anime Streaming Website, a simple yet functional application built with **Next.js 15**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and powered by **MongoDB**. This project serves as a basic skeleton for an anime streaming site, showcasing fundamental features commonly found in anime platforms.

## Features

-   Stream your favorite anime shows and movies
-   User-friendly interface with responsive design
-   Basic functionalities akin to standard anime streaming websites
-   Database structure outlined in the model files for easy reference

## Purpose

This project not only aims to provide a foundational frame for an anime streaming website but also serves as a learning resource. It's an excellent way to understand how various technologies come together in web development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (installed and running)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```

git clone https://github.com/VenkatLohithDasari/anime-streaming.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```

cd anime-streaming

```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
```

npm install

```

4. Set up the environment variables (you may need to create a `.env.local` file):
```

MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

```

5. Start the development server:
```

npm run dev

```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Video Demo

## Future Plans
We are currently working on a more complex and fully-fledged anime streaming website that will utilize **TypeScript**. The advantages of using TypeScript include:
- **Strong Typing**: Helps catch errors at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Offers better tooling, such as autocompletion and type checking, enhancing productivity and code maintainability.
- **Enhanced Refactoring**: Easier to manage large codebases with structured code and clearly defined data types.

The repository link for the TypeScript version will be updated here once available.

## Conclusion
We hope this project helps you learn and explore the implementation of an anime streaming website. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

Happy coding!
